  - 35 g bread flour

## Directions

1. Mix levain ingredients and rest in a warm area (70-80F) for 5 hours
1. One hour before your levain is done, mix together your bread flour and
   whole wheat flour. Add 580g of your water to the flour mixture (keeping
   100g to the side for mixing later)
1. Mix just until your dough comes together. Cover with plastic wrap and
   let it rest in a warm area (same as your starter) for 1 hour
1. Mix your dough and levain together using a little of your separated
   water to help incorporate. Rest 20 minutes.
1. Add your sea salt and the rest of your separated water and mix until
   incorporated. Slap and fold for 2-4 minutes or until your dough is smooth
   and begins to catch some air. Rest 15 minutes in the same warm area you
   placed your starter
1. Perform 6 sets of stretch and folds spaced out by 15 minutes for the
   first 3, then 30 minutes for the next 3. Make sure to place your dough
   back in the warm area for each rest
1. Let your dough rest for a remainder of 1.5 hours, for a total of 4 hours
1. Dump out and divide your dough into 2 even pieces. Preshape each piece
   into a light boule and rest 5-10 minutes
1. Shape your dough into 2 batards and place into bannetons dusted with
   either rice flour or all purpose flour
1. Chill in the fridge overnight
1. Preheat a cast iron combo cooker in your oven from cold to 500â„‰ for 1 hour
1. Carefully place a dusted loaf into the hot pan, score the top, place the
   larger lid on top, and bake for 20 minutes
1. Remove the top from the combo cooker and lower the oven temperature to
   450F. Bake for an additional 20-30 minutes or until the loaf is deep brown
